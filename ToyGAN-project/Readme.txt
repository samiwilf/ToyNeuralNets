generate images. True example is perfect inversion. Negative example is not perfect inversion.


See if GAN can learn single-answer problem. (e.g. 4x4 image color inversion test) 

After, make simple multi-answer problem. (e.g. 4x4 white pixels into random color pixels)

After, make multi-answer problem (e.g. 4x4 CCL output given black/white input.)
