This Toy Gan project started as an attempt to create an GAN that generates inverted images.
To simplify the project, it turned into an attempt to generate inverted 1 pixel images (images consisting of 1 pixel)
In other words, it became inverting a number between/including 0 and 1.


generate images. True example is perfect inversion. Negative example is not perfect inversion.


See if GAN can learn single-answer problem. (e.g. 4x4 image color inversion test) 

After, make simple multi-answer problem. (e.g. 4x4 white pixels into random color pixels)

After, make multi-answer problem (e.g. 4x4 CCL output given black/white input.)
